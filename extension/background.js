/**
 * Service worker: the only part of the extension that talks to the app.
 *
 * The pairing token lives here and in chrome.storage.local, never in a content

 * ask this worker to post observations about the page it is already reading; it
 * cannot read the token, cannot reach the app on its own (the app refuses a
 * https://chatgpt.com origin), and there is no message that makes the app touch a
 * file, run a command or change a permission.
 *
 * Discovery is a scan of five fixed loopback ports for a /hello that identifies the
 * app. Nothing is broadcast and nothing listens.
 *
 * This worker also owns the observation journal. A content script lives only as long as
 * its page: a reload, a navigation or a crash takes its memory with it, and ChatGPT
 * virtualises old turns, so what is gone is often gone for good. So a content script
 * hands an observation over immediately and the durable copy lives here, in
 * chrome.storage.session — which survives this worker being shut down (Chrome does that
 * after seconds of idling) and dies with the browser, which is the right lifetime for a
 * record the app has not accepted yet.

 * clear the stamp. When one does not — an aborted navigation, a redirect that reports a
 * second `loading` after the replacement has already registered, a soft route change, a
 * prerender that never commits — the stamp lands on the tab's own live document, and from
 * then on `authorizeDocument` answers `tab_closed` to every message it sends while

 * browser could clear it, so the tab kept reading ChatGPT perfectly and delivered none of
 * it until the user happened to reload. That is the 2026-08-21 blackout: a live tab whose
 * request-id evidence never reached the app, so `agents action=spawn` was refused with
 * UNIDENTIFIED_CALLER while the popup showed the request id it had already read.
 *
 * A message arriving here is itself the disproof. Chrome does not deliver `runtime.sendMessage`
 * from a document that no longer exists, so an inbound message from the tab's *current*

 * Restores the page half of the bridge after this extension itself is updated/reloaded.
 *
 * Chrome invalidates an extension's isolated content-script world when the extension is
 * reloaded, but it does not reload the user's already-open ChatGPT document. The dead
 * content.js then cannot send observations, request-id evidence or even the conversation's
 * first /events batch, while fiber.js can remain visibly alive in the page's MAIN world.
 * That exact split produces a healthy MCP tunnel plus a permanently growing Unattributed
 * session and no session at all for the ChatGPT tab.
 *
 * runtime.onInstalled fires for unpacked Reload as an update, so repair only at that real
 * lifecycle boundary — never from the service worker's ordinary wake/sleep cycle. The
 * isolated content script has its own one-instance guard because a newly loading page can
 * receive both its static manifest injection and this recovery injection.
