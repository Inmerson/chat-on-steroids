/**
 * Where the pressure meter turns amber and red.
 *
 * These are measured in *this app's* units — `estimateTokens`, four characters to a token,
 * over the events it kept — and not in whatever ChatGPT counts. The two are not the same
 * number and never will be: the app cannot see the system prompt, the memory, the file
 * attachments or the model's own reasoning, and ChatGPT's counter is private.
 *
 * So the thresholds are calibrated against observed behaviour rather than a published
 * context window. The first pair (180k/200k) was set from the published figure, and a real
 * session then ran past 400k of these units before ChatGPT would take no more — meaning the
 * meter had been demanding a compaction since roughly the halfway mark, for hours, on a
 * chat that was fine. A warning that cries wolf at half the real capacity is a warning
 * people learn to click past, which costs more than having no warning at all.
 *
 * 300k/400k put the amber line where there was still comfortable room to compact and the
 * red line at the point that had actually been seen to fail. In use that was still early:
 * chats sat amber and compacted themselves well before anything was wrong with them, and a
 * threshold that fires on a conversation that is fine costs a fresh chat every time. The
 * window is 400k now, at the figure the ceiling has actually been observed near, and the
 * red line follows it a third further on.
 *
 * All of it remains a setting, because the real ceiling moves with the account, the model
 * and the size of what is attached.
