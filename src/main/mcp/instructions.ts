/**
 * Server instructions shown to the model once, alongside the tool list.
 *
 * Kept short on purpose: this text is prepended to context on every conversation that uses
 * the connector, and the tool descriptions already carry the per-tool detail. It states
 * what exists and how to be efficient — it is not where security is enforced.
 *
 * Written per surface. Two connectors mean two of these, and each says only what its own
 * tools can do: telling the Core conversation about `computer` would be describing a tool
 * that server does not have, which is exactly the confusion the split exists to end.
